    <p>Catherine comes from a typical working class family, locally born and bred in Singapore, and grew up in a median bell curve environment, within a region that used to be called exotic but no longer. She considered herself average and destined as another proletarian with a routine life ever-after. During her teens. She boldly asked God for an experiential life, a life anything but mediocre. She now has her stories tattooed on her as a reminder of each event. The OM sign on her back is to make sure she keeps to her renewed determination to stay free spirited in spite of the odds. Through the last twenty years, she has come to accept her wanderlust, frontier mentality, foolhardy idealism and the desire to encompass a greater world. Her Yoga Lab,  is a personal emblem to remind her to treat life as a playground, to experiment and record the learnings. So besides her daily interest in yoga and design, she writes stories. And she wants to tell those stories - of others and hers, in familiar or foreign land - as seen through the eyes of a vata dosha INFP.
